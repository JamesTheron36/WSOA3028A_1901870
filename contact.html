	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		Evening brothers! Welcome to Ron Jamesâ€™s Spell Palace, a place for wizards of all exps. Here on this blog site, join me as we discuss the many magical possibilities of the modern technological age of wizardry. I am someone who enjoys talking about the many facets of the magical world as data and information flies through the air for all of you, the readers to enjoy.
	</p>
	<p>
		But let me tell you a little about myself. I enjoy indulging in the wonderful world that is games. Games of all kinds. Playing a tabletop role playing game with my fellow wizards as we explore a more abstract world of sorcery that is the imagination. My favourite kinds of games are those made possible by the new age schools of wizardry: digital games. I am quite passionate about playing them and synthesizing them in my workshop of wizardry. I am a firm believer that in order for one to create a game effectively, one must be well versed in conversing and thinking critically about the act of playing games which is also one of my favourite activities. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I currently reside in the small city of Johannesburg and favorite things to do around the city are explore the local parks and visiting the highest points to check out the views.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also a frequent passenger on the train which is the world wide web and the enchanting possibilities that come along with an interconnected, world wide network. From the social platforms to the video sharing and even playing games in the browser. Few things that are done these days are outside of the browser. I embrace the negative and positive aspects of the internet as overall I feel it creates a magic that nothing else can replicate. 
	</p>

	<p>
		So join me on this journey of wizardry and sorcery as we explore the ins and outs of the tech world.
