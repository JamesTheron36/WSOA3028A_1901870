	<h2>Usability and Accessibility on the Web</h2>
	<p>
		When the idea for a large interconnected network of computers was originally conceived, the last thing the people working on itâ€™s development might have been thinking was, how can we make this easy and appealing to the average Joe? You know, the regular guy who is just trying to find out how to make soft boiled eggs without overdoing it. Or maybe some disenfranchised child like myself who was just looking to play some stupid flash games during IT class. The internet was originally devised for strict military use and to provide a platform for scientists who were finding themselves needing to use more and more computing machines in the mid 1960s. Pretty far removed from what we now call the world wide web.
	</p>
	<p>
		But as time passed, it soon became obvious that a world wide, interconnected computer network had a lot of potential for a variety of different things. The invention of the web browser truly made it into something that everybody could use. Thus came the need to make the user experience easy and accessible as the web became so intertwined with the business of everyday life. Layers of abstraction began to form which allowed for a comprehensive interface that strives to be as accessible as possible. Those looking to connect with the public would strive to make their websites user friendly in order to effectively communicate their desired web experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		Personalised web pages became all the rage since the introduction of web 2.0.  Accessibility on a website interface means effectively communicating to the user where they can find all your web service has to offer. Intending to be able to cater for the many different types of users. This often manifests itself in the form of a simple navigation bar with hyperlinks which take the user to the various web pages available. Keeping it consistent with other well known websites will also help users plug in and play without having to get used to a new arrangement.  Other forms of navigation which are easily recognisable are things like buttons and hyperlinks. Combining easy to identify navigation with a clear and readable page layout creates a smooth experience which users have become accustomed to over the years of web usage. The use of imagery to help users process the information put before them in a visual manner. Images may have accompanying text to give further context on a primarily visual experience. Sounds and tactile feedback can also help give the user a sense of interactivity when using a website. For instance, if you hover over a link and it highlights, you gain a new sense of awareness of how you are affecting an otherwise static page of information.
