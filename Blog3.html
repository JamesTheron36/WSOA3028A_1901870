	<h2>The Information Portal that is the Internet Browser</h2>
	<p>
		The potential of an all encompassing network is not yet realised without the proper tools to operate and control the sea of ones and zeros that float around in the ether. The wizardry of passing info through the realm of electromagnetic radiation is a complicated beast but is easily tamed by your average joe with the fantastic invention that is the internet browser. This portal into the digital space provides the user with a connection into a reality of ultimate communication improving upon the predecessor of sending notes attached to pigeons (or owls in alternative realities with a less developed understanding of magic).  A multiverse of culture and industry forms through the practices which take place through the manifestation of bits in the form of waves in the visible and audible spectrum. A wild west of content exhibiting some of Darwinâ€™s natural selection principles in its most basic form.
