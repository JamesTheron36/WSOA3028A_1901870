	<h2>AI Driven World</h2>
	<p>
		The magic of technology has been edging further and further into our lives for the sake of recreation and convenience but a bright technological future also casts a dark shadow. The emergence of AI is already making its way into our everyday lives as companies like Amazon and Netflix pour investments into AI-driven technology for the sake of trying to have an edge in the consumer market. AI might have the fun, marketable side to it that Amazon and Apple love to tout in their virtual assistants which use AI to adjust to the person using them. But the dark side on the horizon may be corporations using the technology to reduce the number of jobs and cut corners on employee background checks. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The first issue is how the age of AI may be a future we are perhaps not ready for as it may leave a lot of employees in popular jobs obsolete. As stated by 2020, American Presidential candidate, Andrew Yang - “All you need is self-driving cars to destabilize society”. Automated vehicles stand a significant threat to those working as professional drivers which currently serves as the backbone to economies all over the world. In the United States alone, there are over 3.5 million truck drivers who are responsible for 10.73 billions tons worth of goods this year. The only people which would benefit from automated vehicles replacing professional drivers would be those saving the money on employing them. A technological advance that perhaps our current society is not ready for but maybe on the horizon sooner rather than later.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next issue regarding AI is perhaps already being currently deployed among us is companies using artificial intelligence to perform background checks on their employees.  Companies like Checkr and Fama help corporations cut costs during the hiring process by providing an AI-driven background checking software that looks at applicant’s social media activity and criminal history. This sounds okay if not a breach of privacy, but the problem is that it isn’t as accurate as it needs to be. Mistakes in identity occur frequently and social media data is often deemed to be ‘problematic’. It all reinforces the ability to discriminate against applicants with a nice cheap alternative to the traditional background checking methods.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of the day, the use of artificial intelligence is growing and it’s just a matter of time before we find ourselves in an AI-driven world. Let’s just hope it’s made to function with our best interests at heart.
