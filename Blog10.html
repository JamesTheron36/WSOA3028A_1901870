	<h2>YouTube: an Analysis of User Experience</h2>
	<p>
		User Experience, or UX for short, is how the user feels when interacting with a particular product or service. It could be a positive experience, it could be a negative experience or it could be an experience rife with insidious intent. In the modern-day and age, we are bombarded with different user experiences as the consumerist lifestyle becomes more and more integrated with our every action. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In this extract, I intend to discuss and analyse the implementation of user experience in the online video-sharing service, YouTube. YouTube is perhaps the digital service that I use more than any other and it has been around for quite a few years now. Its user Experience has evolved as it has become one of the most visited sites on the entire web.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		If you were to load up the youtube home, having not logged in, the service merely displays a home with hyperlinks and thumbnails for the current most popular videos. Being unable to link any viewing history or interests to any sort of account, the service merely looks at your location and determines what people in your general area have been watching and recommends those videos to you. The experience changes vastly if you are to log in. Your YouTube account keeps track of your entire video watching history on the service. This allows its highly sophisticated algorithm to select what feels like a never-ending selection of curated video content and just send the user down the bottomless rabbit hole of viewership and discovery. One could spend a lifetime just letting the videos play on queue and letting the recommendation algorithm do its thing. This is an effective tool that YouTube employs as it is effective in deciphering what kind of content a user is interested in watching. The service then takes this information gathered and effectively uses it to maintain the user’s attention and engagement. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The next tool in YouTube’s box of user experience techniques is their subscription feature. This allows users to further feed YouTube’s algorithm with information by directly telling it which content creators they enjoy and wish to see more content from. Users subscribe to creators they particularly enjoy watching and it builds a personally curated subscriptions page that only includes videos from the channels they are specifically subscribed to. This allows the user to get involved in the curation of their own experience when using the service and keep up to date with the creators they have an affinity with.
	</p>
	<p>
		With regards to the layout of the webpage when one is indulging in a video, the placement of the interactive elements is set up deliberately. The current video is intended to be the focus of the page as it is the largest element that appears on the screen. This is followed by a series of smaller video thumbnails that represent the videos YouTube recommends you watch next. The call to action which appears on the page is the ‘Sign in’ button as this unlocks more of the service’s benefits.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Everything regarding user experience which YouTube employs intends to achieve a single goal: more hours spent watching by the user. The Youtube bottom line is based on advertisements being shown before videos so the more time spent watching videos, the more valuable the ad space becomes to investing companies. This leads to the positive use of UX as well as the dark, insidious use of UX. On the positive end, YouTube provides a platform with an endless amount of content that can be highly beneficial to both users and creators. Videos can be used for both educational and recreational purposes. The dark side of the intention is that users may find themselves being sucked into what can be quite an addictive cycle that distracts them from what could be in their best interests. The user experience is geared towards making users want to consume as much content as possible but spending too much time doing so can become a real problem for some. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All in all, how YouTube shapes its customer's user experience is effective in keeping people engaged with what they have to offer in terms of service. It can be a blessing or a curse depending on how many hours you find yourself consuming.
