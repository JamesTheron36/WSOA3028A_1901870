	<h2>Blurred Lines: a Digital and Physical World</h2>
	<p>
        As we find ourselves falling deeper and deeper into the age of information, the divide between the physical world and the digital world has perhaps never been more blurry. As the ones and zeros fly through the air, we find humanity advancing in a kind of roller coaster type fashion as information now travels faster than we are perhaps comfortable with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The wild wild west that is the world wide web has become the most dominant medium of communication. This was already on it’s way to becoming the case beforehand but the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic has seen the need to use digital communications skyrocket. The word of the day is social-distance which means the digital world has almost become some kind of temporary substitute for the the physical world. I personally have seen my campus days at university in Johannesburg being significantly cut short and replaced by ‘online learning’. Socializing has been reduced to chatting with friends over discord and scrolling through social media. The magic of the digital world does seem to fade when it’s trying to replace the physical world. The problem being is that there are aspects of the physical world which struggle to be replaced with digital substitutes. The biggest difficulty is perhaps, ironically, replacing the authenticity of physical world communication. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The digital world may provide an easy and convenient method of sending messages between one another but it still struggles to replicate the warmness of physical communication and interaction. Particularly in the case of talking through text, humans weren’t designed to convey their emotions through digital characters. This is often the way of the world in the case of social media interaction. This fails to replicate general context and implication which is present is real world, spoken word interaction. This creates an augmented space of digital communication where people sometimes find it difficult to get along.
    </p>
    <p>
        The augmentation of the physical world by means of the digital world is becoming more and more prominent. Especially since the introduction of the black magic that is smart phones. Using the global position system, or GPS, technology is able to adapt to our current location and provide relevant information based on this knowledge. This is often capitalized upon by those looking to advertise who use location based marketing to try and tempt potential customers with local marketing opportunities and coupons. Video games that use GPS and augmented reality mechanics like Pokemon GO use the technology to merge the real world with that of a digital game which encourages people to go outside and search for digital items. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The real world and the digital world have never been closer and the lines separating them have never been blurrier. How this will impact us in the long run is somewhat unknown but the convenience does not necessarily go without a price.
