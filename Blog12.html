	<h2>UI and UX: a Rundown</h2>
	<p>
		User experience and user interface are vital mechanisms that make up a website. It’s what keeps the user engaged with the content. User experience is the feeling your service inspires within the user, is the experience of using your website cathartic or is it just frustrating? The designer must be aware and in control of how they influence the emotional response within the user. On the other hand, the user interface is the tool that the designer uses to invoke such feelings within the user along with the content they put out. The set-up of a website’s user interface dictates how the user perceives what is laid before them on the screen. The flow and architecture of the site influence the user’s ability to navigate through the collection of pages. Is the website set up to allow the user to easily get the most out of the content or are things hidden for them to find?
	</p>
		
	<p>
		The layout of the ‘blogs’ page is the next most important thing as it houses all of the articles Ron Jame’s Spell Palace has to offer. The layout is simple and consists of a series of equally-weighted preview elements which represent each of the various articles. Each preview consists of a title, a loosely related image and a hyperlink to the article. All of the attention should be drawn towards these article preview sections as they are laid out in a consistent and centralised manner. The imagery and title are intended to give the user a brief idea of what the article is about.

	</p>
	<p>
		The home page is where the user is directed to when visiting the site’s URL so it’s important to give a first impression of what the site is about. This is done by including a short article that introduces Ron James to the reader. This is followed by some more preview sections which link the user to the wireframes section of the site as well as the character rationale blog post which goes into more detail about the Ron James character. The content on this page is light but it intends to provide a gateway into the rest of the website. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, the layout of each blog page is set up to be simple and merely communicate the content with the article. The title of the blog post appears at the top of the body of the text but below the site logo to remain consistent with other content on the site. The times in new Roman font was selected to be easily readable to the user and convey an old classy look that is consistent with all the text on the various pages.
