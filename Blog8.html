	<h2>The Digital Divide</h2>
	<p>
		The birth of the world wide web in the early 1990s was considered to be a momentous advancement at the time but it was impossible to imagine the significance of the invention in the years to come. It brought with it, the digital sphere - a world of information separate from the world we were familiar with - a digital divide. It was the moment when humanity was truly able to perceive the sheer magnitude of how many voices there are out there as there was suddenly a reality where the world could connect within a digital space. The wizards who constructed this invention may have had an idea that this was big but could not have guessed what would manifest from there. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Humanity became aware of its own magnitude and various complexities but it could only view it through a digital lens, thus creating a digital divide between the real world and the digital world. There was both an understanding as well as a misunderstanding simultaneously. The ability to communicate with someone on the other side of the globe became possible but this communication would often take the form of limited text or pre-recorded video. The popular digital space of Twitter formed, which is basically just people speaking the written word into an endless void of text, hoping that someone else will take the time to read what they have to say. Twitter, as well as other similar social platforms create a digital perspective of how the general public is feeling. But this information is not so easily grasped for us mere mortals as millions of people operating and communicating in one large digital environment is a more complicated beast than one might have thought. Our understanding and perception of our neighbours is a difficult problem which we may not have considered if it weren’t thrust into the spotlight by the digital divide. Our old ideas of the real world have been warped by the overflow of information which floats through the air around us.
	</p>
	<p>
		The world might share one big digital space that is the world wide web, but content added can generally be traced back to a specific country of origin. For instance, users in first world countries create content that may differ from someone posting from a developing nation. If a person’s experiences are reflected in their character, then they’ll likely be reflected in the content they post too. Someone born and bred in the city will have a different outlook on life when compared to someone who grew up in a small town and village. The internet boasts a user base of over 2.5 billion meaning that every nation has some kind of representation online. Information relevant to pretty much every person of all backgrounds may be found somewhere.
