<h2>The Wonderful World of Digital Games Today</h2>
	<p>
		Few things these days can compare to the magic present when you open up a brand spanking new game that you just purchased on the virtual online store known as Steam. The current state of gaming as we know it owes a lot to the accessibility and presence of the world wide web. It provides a platform to connect us players to do what we do be, play the games. Different genres of online multiplayer games have formed and buying games has never been easier with various online platforms like Steam. Mass multiplayer games, games as a service, free to play games have all been made possible in the modern interconnected age. That weird platformer from the mid 2000s that you loved but nobody knows about? Guess what, it’s on sale on steam for $3 and you can have it downloaded and running in 10 minutes. You found a game breaking bug in that new game you bought? Report it and the sorcerer developers may just release a patch fixing it. Your wizard homies out of town for the weekend but you still wanna play games together? Now you can play together over the internet. The world wide web has also brought a lot of attention towards digital games. Before, gaming was very much seen as a niche hobby. Now it’s the most popular and lucrative media format and practically everybody these days qualifies as a gamer. The internet also serves as an archive for wizards like me to experience all the old games of a yester era in the form of roms that I can run on the associated emulators.

		This new age of online gaming does come with a catch. With games becoming as popular as they are, the corporatization of games has never been more pervalent. Games have been overfunded and built up to an expectation that they can never meet. This has led to games being released unfinished, as developers have the crutch of patching the problems to fall back on. The over saturation of the market sees a lot of dead wood rise as corporations put out what I like to refer to as “corporate slosh”, games that try to appeal to as many people as possible but just end up being uninteresting and run of the mill. Focus group driven games and bland, microtransaction filled multiplayer games that die out after six months because nobody ends up actually playing and enjoying the games.

		The new age of digital games has it’s pros and cons but it truly is a magnificent form of artistry when it all comes together. The format allows for an interactive medium for both fun and narrative. It truly is a work of magic.
